Microsoft 365 is a suite of apps that help you stay connected and get things done.   It include all the common MS Office apps like Word and Excel, plus the online tools like SharePoint, Teams, Skype (if that's really still a thing), plus Identity Management through Azure Active Directory!


This initially started out as a basic text file in my OneNote to reference all the things I would need for any given situation or client ticket, but it keeps growing and I figured I should share it with anyone else who works with 365 as much as I do.  I hope it comes in handy!
